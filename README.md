# Nodejs app uses Chainlink Data Feed

### A simple nodejs app which fetches USD prices of digital assets like BTC, ETH, MATIC, LIN and AAVE from Chainlink Polygon Mainnet.

### How to run locally?
```sh
# install all the dependencies
$ npm install

# run
$ npm start
```

## 🧠 Learnings?
- web3 providers gives us the ability to interact with the Blockchain Node. I started experimenting using Infura which was based on ethereum, but as I was curious about Polygon, then moved to Alchemy, which gives the polygon mainnet provider.
- We can also run a local private blockchain using Ganache.

## ❗Known Issues
- Promise.all may create issues because of its nature.
